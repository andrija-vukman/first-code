# first-code by Andrija Vukman
Hello World!

This is my first code ever written (starting date: 2025-04-30).

I personally chose C for my first language, since I wanted to learn a compiler-based language which teaches you the basic syntax for more languages and still illustrates basic ideas of memory management, etc. However, I didn't want to get into OOP right at the start. ChatGPT was used for help.

IMPORTANT:
The purpose of this upload is to show my personal start in coding in general. This serves as a reference containing my first coding experience. Everything is summed up in one file and is commented out. Feel free to read through it, but don't get too excited; the majority of the code shows the lack of experience and the use of ChatGPT.

Yours faithfully,
Andrija Vukman
